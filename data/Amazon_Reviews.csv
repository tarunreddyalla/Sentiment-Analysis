"Even after just the first scene of the first episode, I could tell it was going to be good. I could tell from the very first scene of Rings of Power that it was going to be terrible. You won't see a ridiculous rock-sinking-explanation in House of the Dragon. It's actually written by adults."
"House of Dragon has delivered on everything and took notes where game of thrones fell short. Definitely recommend, If youâ€™re interested In revisiting Westeros!"

Hated game of thrones. loved house of dragons. Get you a man that looks at you like Harwin Strong looked at Rhaenyra coming back from the hunt. All parents should raise their kids to be like Willem Blackwood. Have sympathy for a poor court iminstrel left on repeat. The leads are doing their best soap opera stuff but the background characters win the show.
"I really wanted to have this spin-off pick up along the threads of entertainment GOT offered us in a world of corporate formulaic excess. What we have is a woke agenda too worried about crossing off check-boxes to eben consider character devedlopement, storyline, plot, or even viewing pleasure. The pace of the weak story further strangles whatever life there could have been in this undertaking. The switch of actors helped nothing. The boldness of GOT is nowhere to be found. Yet we find incest, rape, homosexuality, and any other so deviance front and center to every scene. There are much better ways to invest time and money. This is DOA."
"HBOâ€™s quality keeps on giving. So well cast, fantastic script/story line, loyal to the book. Visual effects and costumesâ€¦ perfection. Rating 5*/5"
"This can't compare with the original 8 seasons of Game of thrones. The new series was very boring because every episode was the same drama within the house of dragons.

The 8 seasons of Game of thrones series displayed multiple dramas throughout the kingdom which made it very interesting.

Font waste your money in this and save your money if you haven't bought the 8 seasons disc in 4k. The house of dragons is a fail such a shame."
This series has been absolutely excellent. I am preordering it. Exceptionally done.
Watched the first three had to stop. Actor selection for characters was terrible. Character development was poor. They woked the hell out of everything catering to a select crowd. Scenery was not on par with Lord of the Rings in which they spent enough money to do such. I was not impressed by the CGI either. They spent enough on this to be leading edge in CGI which everything was standard or lower. Amazon should sue the developer for not providing what they paid for.
"Who ever green lit the choice of changing actors, ruined the show!"
"What do you have once you remove all the problematic moral aspects and gratuitous sex, whoring, misogyny, rape and rampant bloody violence from Game of Thrones? You have ""House of The Dragon"", the boring, tedious, drab, humorless, vapid, insipid, gray adventures and torments of cipher like princesses surrounded by totally forgettable male characters engaged in a narrative that no one cares about. In fact, the only way the female characters have been made interesting has been to make the male characters so insipid and blank that the women seem dynamic in comparison. Cersei Lannister would have eaten all these gray women for breakfast. Tyrion Lannister would have skewered them with haughty commentary and droll ironic observations. And, it's worth pointing out, that although Daenerys Targaryen was in many ways a compelling character that she was also in many ways a boring, joyless pill. Making an entire series about her joyless and, it seems, almost bloodless, cipher like ancestors doesn't seem like such a good idea. HBO has been firing a lot of people. They should fire every executive that OKed this series to go into production."

"I would give this show 5 stars easy, it was so good. The acting is top-notch, it looks beautiful and the writing has far exceeded my expectations. I just knocked it down a star, because there were so many deleted scenes and they are not added to any of the these. At least as far as I can see. I'm going to wait and see if they release those on another one later.
I would recommend this to anyone, at least through Episode 8. I won't mention why here because of spoilers. but it's well worth anyone's time."

From a person who has read the G.O.T books and the house of the dragon book, i have a pretty informed opinion. The book was terrible. The show had a lot to live up too but it exceeded my expectation. The plot is strong and the characters develop quickly. There are some things i dont like. The changing of the characters. The time jumps. All in all it had big shoes and expectations to fill. I can tell you that what weve seen so far is nothing. There are many dragons and they do a lot or fighting. Cant wait for season 2!

"As disappointing as the final season of Game of Thrones was, House of the Dragons managed to exceed of the expectations I had for the series especially as a huge Daenerys Targaryen fan. Though limited in perspectives unlike its predecessor, somehow, this show feels just as massive and epic through its story telling, production design, etc. It isn't just about fighting for the chance to sit on a throne, but the complexity of political, power, patriarchal struggles along with the added struggles that plagues every family--even those of the dragon. It's what makes this show feel more human than Game of Thrones, but maybe that's speaking too soon especially considering the last episode."
"As someone who has read the book that the show is based off of and every season of the original show I've got to give this show mad props. It redeems the series after the original Season 8, and follows the book material almost word for word/scene for scene with few major creative differences. I love it so far, can't wait to see the Dance of the Dragons in season 2!"
Excellent show. HBO nailed it with this one after the Game of Thrones ending a few years ago. The Dragons are honestly so cool and much better looking this time around. Looking forward to Season 2!
"This show is really good in terms of writing, acting, casting and dialogue and Im happy George is connected to the project"
If you were a fan of game of thrones in its prime this show is that turned up to 11. I wonâ€™t spoil anything that happens but this is the best season of a tv show ever made.
"This show is amazing! A brilliant prequel to Game of Thrones - Honestly, I love to hate all of the characters. I think the ending of GOT was disappointing, but from how this season has been unfolding, I am getting reinvested into this world again. I cannot wait for Season 2 to come out!! They need to hurry up and get to filming so we can watch what happens with the Targaryens and the Hightowers!!!"
